### Ideas

- Use key-value (int, task) in db instead of list: faster lookup (no need for search loop).
- Add progress bar using https://github.com/vbauerster/mpb or https://github.com/schollz/progressbar
- Stylized output with https://github.com/Ullaakut/disgo.
- Use Travis for CI.
- Add colors using https://github.com/gookit/color
- Use TermUI: https://github.com/gizak/termui
